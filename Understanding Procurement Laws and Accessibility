# Understanding Procurement Laws and Accessibility

Learning Objectives:
==========

By the end of this tutorial, learners will be able to:

1. Define procurement laws and how they ensure accessibility.
2. Identify key components of procurement laws, focusing on accessibility.
3. Understand the role of VPATs in procurement processes.
4. Learn the steps to validate a vendor's product for accessibility compliance.
5. Recognize key principles of procurement laws and their impact on accessibility.
6. Understand the relationship between procurement laws and disability rights frameworks like the ADA.

## Introduction to Procurement Laws and Accessibility

**What is Procurement Law?**

Procurement laws govern how organizations acquire goods and services. These laws ensure that products and services purchased are accessible to people with disabilities. For example, Section 508 requires that U.S. federal agencies acquire accessible electronic products. 

While vendors aren’t legally required to create accessible products, agencies must only purchase items that meet accessibility standards or are the most accessible option available.

## Key Components of Procurement Laws

The four standard  components of procurement laws include:

1. General Provisions: These outline the purpose, scope, and definitions related to procurement, including accessibility terms like "universal design."
2. Procurement Principles: Transparency, fair competition, and value for money are key principles. Accessibility is incorporated to ensure equal opportunity for vendors and users with disabilities.
3. Procurement Methods: Includes competitive bidding and e-procurement systems, which must be accessible.
4. Eligibility and Qualification Criteria: Vendors must meet accessibility standards to participate.

## The Role of VPATs in Procurement Laws

**What are VPATs?**

VPATs (Voluntary Product Accessibility Templates) help organizations assess how accessible a product is. They provide documentation that shows whether a product complies with accessibility standards like Section 508 or WCAG.

How do VPATs Support Procurement Laws?

1. Providing proof of Compliance: VPATs demonstrate that products meet accessibility standards.

2. Supporting Decisions: Helping procurement teams choose accessible products.

3. Holding Vendors Accountable: Vendors are motivated to ensure accessibility when they know their VPAT will be evaluated.

4. Making Accessibility Part of the Process: VPATs standardize accessibility documentation.

## Validating Vendor Products for Accessibility Compliance

**Steps to Validate Accessibility**

1. Request and Review Documentation: Ask for a VPAT or ACR (Accessibility Conformance Report) to see how the product meets accessibility standards.
2. Ask for a Demo: Ensure the product works with assistive technologies like screen readers.
3. Conduct Internal Testing: Test the product with accessibility tools.
4. Engage Experts: Consult accessibility experts for a thorough review.
5. Perform Gap Analysis: Identify accessibility gaps and work with the vendor to address them.
6. Negotiate Accessibility in Contracts: Include clauses that hold vendors accountable for accessibility.

## Key Principles of Procurement Laws

Procurement laws follow principles that promote:

* Transparency: Processes must be clear and accessible to all.
* Fair Competition: Ensure equal opportunity, including for vendors that meet accessibility standards.
* Value for Money: Consider both cost and the long-term benefits of accessibility.
* Accountability and Ethics: Vendors must maintain accessibility, and procurement officials must adhere to ethical standards.
* Efficiency: Streamline processes to avoid delays, while ensuring accessibility is prioritized.

## The Relationship Between Procurement Laws and Disability Rights Laws

{1}{__Shared Goals: Both aim to ensure that products and services are accessible to people with disabilities.__}

{2}{__Implementation: Procurement laws help organizations meet ADA standards by requiring accessible products.__}

{3}{__Universal Design: These laws promote designing products that work for everyone, not just those with disabilities.__}

What is the primary purpose of a VPAT in procurement?

-[( )] To evaluate a product’s cost.

-[(X)] To prove a product’s accessibility compliance.

-[( )] To test a product's market demand.

-[( )] To get the best deal on a product.

-[[?]] Remember, those responsible for acquisitions can refer to information in the VPAT when deciding which product(s) are more compliant with accessibility guidelines.

True/False: Procurement laws are only relevant for government acquisitions.

-[( )] True

-[(X)] False
-[[?]] Remember, while government procurement is often subject to specific statutory and regulatory frameworks (e.g., FAR in the U.S.), private sector entities also follow procurement laws and best practices to ensure compliance with contractual obligations, fairness, and ethical standards in sourcing goods and services.

## Conclusion

Procurement laws are crucial for ensuring that products and services are accessible to everyone. By using tools like VPATs and following proper validation steps, organizations can make sure they are meeting accessibility standards. Procurement laws also promote fairness, transparency, and accountability while aligning with disability rights frameworks like the ADA.
